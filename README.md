# Breakout_QLearner
THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS !! - feel free to comment and improve. some stuff is redundant or optional, some is not (yet) fully implemented.


- my Convolutional-Neural-Network "Rudolf" is learning to play Breakout
- some stuff was taken from here: https://github.com/Kuax-Meat/Snake-Reinforcement-Deep-Q-Learning

using:
- Tensorflow
- pygame
- python36
- RAMDISK is used for saving NetStates 
- plus a Textfile is saved there, for plotting with matplotlib


P.S. I know this code is a mess. sry for that. Im just interested in it.
     If someone has an idea, your welcome !!

- start with: "python breakout07_train.py"
